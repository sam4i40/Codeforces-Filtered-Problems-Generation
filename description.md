# Motivation
Basically, this is a web application for students who are interested in competitive programming. Sometimes, students unknowingly solve problems that they previously had solved. Sometimes, students may need to find problems that meet their specific requirements. So, we decided to create a web application which solves the problems and helps the students in terms of competitive programming.
